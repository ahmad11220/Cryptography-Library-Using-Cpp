# Crypto_System
### This is a cryptography library implemented in C++ that provides basic encryption and decryption functionality using popular cryptographic algorithms. 
### Currently, the library supports the following algorithms:
<br>-
#### AES (Advanced Encryption Standard): <br>A symmetric block cipher that uses a fixed block size of 128 bits and supports key sizes of 128, 192, or 256 bits. AES is widely used for encrypting sensitive data and is considered to be very secure.
<br>-
#### DES (Data Encryption Standard):<br>A symmetric block cipher that uses a fixed block size of 64 bits and a key size of 56 bits. DES was widely used in the past, but has since been replaced by more secure algorithms like AES.
<br>-
#### RSA (Rivest-Shamir-Adleman):<br>An asymmetric encryption algorithm that is commonly used for key exchange and digital signatures. RSA uses a public key and a private key to encrypt and decrypt data, respectively.
<br>-
#### Caesar Cipher:<br>A simple substitution cipher that shifts each letter in the plaintext by a fixed number of positions in the alphabet. The key for this cipher is the number of positions to shift.
<br>-
#### Columnar Transposition Cipher:<br>A transposition cipher that rearranges the letters in the plaintext according to a predetermined pattern. The key for this cipher is the pattern used to rearrange the letters.
<br>-
#### Hill Cipher: <br>A polygraphic substitution cipher that uses linear algebra to encrypt and decrypt data. The key for this cipher is a matrix that is used to perform the encryption and decryption operations.
<br>-
#### Monoalphabetic Cipher: <br>A substitution cipher that uses a fixed substitution table to encrypt and decrypt data. The key for this cipher is the substitution table.
<br>-
#### Playfair Cipher: <br>A polygraphic substitution cipher that uses a 5x5 matrix of letters to encrypt and decrypt data. The key for this cipher is the matrix used to perform the encryption and decryption operations.
<br>-
#### Rail Fence Cipher: <br>A transposition cipher that writes the plaintext in a zigzag pattern along a set of rails, and then reads off the ciphertext row by row. The key for this cipher is the number of rails used.
<br>-
#### Vigenere AutoKey Cipher: <br>A polyalphabetic substitution cipher that uses a keyword to encrypt and decrypt data. The key for this cipher is the keyword, which is used to generate a series of keystreams that are used to encrypt and decrypt the data.
<br>-
#### Vigenere Repeating Key Cipher:  <br>A polyalphabetic substitution cipher that uses a repeating keyword to encrypt and decrypt data. The key for this cipher is the repeating keyword, which is used to generate a series of keystreams that are used to encrypt and decrypt the data.
